      <description>When I discovered plumber, I fell in love with its versatility. With version 1.0, it is even more versatile and modular than before. Since I had the chance to contribute to the project, I wanted to share some of the new features that made it into this release.
Part 1New annotation @plumberNew tags were introduced in 1.0. @plumber allows users to interact with the router object during its creation process.</description>
