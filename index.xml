      <description>Back in 2018, I had to deploy an R API on kubernetes. It lead to a quick presentation at R à Québec 2019 which is still available here. Since then, I deployed half a dozen more solutions while refining the deployment pipeline. In my opinion, R is a vary viable solution has the stack stays the same through the whole data science cycle. This is more or less the workflow I use.</description>

      <description>I’m a formally credentialed casualty actuary, doing mostly devops and solution engineering in data science. As an old and wise actuary once said, “Aren’t we all data scientist?”. Like many in my fields, I have dabbled in quite a diverse selection of technologies, getting decent with a dozen or so. For everything else, I have a brain and a search engine. Most recently, my main focus has been to prove the viability of R Language based solutions in the insurance industry.</description>
